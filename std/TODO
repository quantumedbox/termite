Ideas for shared standard programs that are useful

- Termite termite
  Small interpreter written in termite that could run code from supplied instream

- Hex to byte
  Could be quite useful, especially in interpreting code

  Example:
    input: |31 35|
    output: |15|

- Icon
  Programs that outputs ASCII image of termite logo

- Stripper
  Recieve stream of termite code and strip all whitespace to make it compressed
  Might be vital in size limited code

- Token count
  Could be vital in termite programs that operate on termite code sequences

- Apply
  Applying of termite magic string invocation for every byte in input

- String functions
  NULL terminated strings are more than possible to work in such environment
  We should get commonly used functions for them such as:

    . len
    . compare
    . append

    and others

- Short arithmetic
  Compose short values from two bytes and implement arithmetic operators for them
