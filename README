Termite is a small stack-based programming language
It operates on interpreting input sequence directly without processing it in any way
Basic structural element of every program is token, there's 3 kinds of them:
    . Hexadecimals : Byte, consists of 2 characters, letters are capital, - example: 00, 32, FA, 4D
    . Literals : Any single ASCII compliment character that doesn't correspond to any operator or hex, - example: a b c
    . Operators : Special symbols that change state of stack or cursor, example -  / @ [

Available operators:
    < Output    : Pop value and output it to STDOUT
    . Drop      : Deletes last value from the stack
    @ Duplicate : Clones last value on the stack
    ^ Swap      : Swaps two last values
    ~ Not       : Toggles least significant bit
    = Equal     : Pops two values, pushes 01 if values are equal or 00 if not
    ? Compare   : Pops two values, pushes 10 if last values was bigger, 00 otherwise
    + Add       : Pops two values, pushes result of addition
    - Subtract  : Pops two values, pushes result of subtraction
    * Multiply  : Pops two values, pushes result of multiplication
    / Divide    : Pops two values, pushes result of division
    # Conveyor  : Moves last value into beginning of stack
    ] Seek      : Pops N value, seeks N tokens forward
    [ Rewind    : Pops N value, rewinds N tokens back

Restrictions:
    . Only 1000 characters could be outputted by discord bot
    . Stack limit is 66560
    . Input limit is 66560, but discord will truncate it

Debugging:
|| After output is state of stack when program finished
