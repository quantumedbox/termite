Language is deliberately minimalist and doesn't implement anything
  that couldn't be expressed by combinations of more basic commands


Some compound operators:

  . Over
    a b
    #@$^
    |a b a|

  . Double over
    a b
    ^@#^@$^
    |a b a b|

  . Rot
    a b c
    #^$^
    |b c a|

  . Mod
    08 03
    #@$@#/$*-
    |02|

  . /Mod
    05 02
    ^@#^@$^/##@$@#/$*-$^
    |02 01|
