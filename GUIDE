This package comes with certain utilities:

  . Worker
    Termite interpreter, main way of actually running termite code
    For it to work you need to supply file path to your code file as its first argument
    It supplies certain amount of debugging tools that are entered by command line arguments,
      to turn on all of them pass "d" after your code path


Termite is deliberately minimalist and doesn't implement anything
  that couldn't be expressed by combinations of more basic commands
  Because of that you have to implement many functionalities by yourself instead

  Here's some reimplementations for things from stack-based land:

  . Over
    a b
    #@$^
    |a b a|

  . Double over
    a b
    ^@#^@$^
    |a b a b|

  . Rot
    a b c
    #^$^
    |b c a|

  . Mod
    08 03
    #@$@#/$*-
    |02|

  . /Mod
    05 02
    ^@#^@$^/##@$@#/$*-$^
    |02 01|
